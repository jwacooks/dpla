# Overview
***

This repository contains a collection of files that represent efforts to obtain and manipulate metadata from the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/info/developers/) (DPLA) via the [DPLA api](http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/). It builds on the work of:

1. [Chad Nelson](https://github.com/bibliotechy/DPyLA)
2. [Ed Summers (and others)](https://github.com/edsu/pymarc)
3. [Martin Czygan](https://github.com/miku/marcx)

 

Most of my work is done using [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/install.html). I use (and greatly appreciate it) but don't support iPython notebook. 

I have tried to document the code in the notebooks to define the flow of the program. Adding some error checking/management would make the code more robust.
